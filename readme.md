# What is pipiSpot?
Just another app that lets you see public toilets. Since some API are not up to date, the app lets you mark some custom points on the map, and share them with the world. Note by accessibility, comfort and privacy.

# Why is it cool (tech reasons)
This is my best code yet. I tried to cram everything I know and can do.
[x] Postgre, Redis, Bloom filters (data speed goes zoom zoom)
[x] Golang with a strict layout (https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout)
[x] Domain Driven Design w/ CQRS 
[x] Docker
[ ] CI, CD

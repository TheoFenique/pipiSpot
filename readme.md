# What is pipiSpot?
Just another app that lets you see public toilets. Since some API are not up to date, the app lets you mark some custom points on the map, and share them with the world. 

# Why is it cool (nerd reasons)

- Postgre, Redis, Bloom filters (data speed goes zoom zoom)
- Golang with a strict architecture
- Docker
- CI, CD
